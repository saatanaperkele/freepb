Torrent Indexer, modeled after TPB, aims to be modular and easily scalable or expandable, can even sub to RSS feeds and index in real time. Magnet links only.

Pages can be added if they follow samples/format.php, functionality can be added easily by the $administrator provided they follow the installation guides
all modules will follow the format outlined in samples/module.php, and insert the proper functions where needed. /mods.php is where all modules will be
include()'d and they can be called where required. A better way of doing this will come along soon, but for now this is the most convienent and doesn't open
up a goatse-sized SPOF. 

tl;dr a bunch of quick TPB-clones will be hosted by tom dick and harry, 
all cross-indexing each other that way when harry gets v&, someone else 
steps in and takes over.
